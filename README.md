### RITLibReserve

RITLibReserve is a small project that simulates a library reservation/request service for library items in advance. This means that students, faculty, and staff can reserve any physical library items or technology ahead of time and have that item ready for them at the pickup desk. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the Visitor Pattern. The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for the addition of new operations to existing classes without modifying their structure. It achieves this by separating the algorithm from the object structure on which it operates. In this case the library items books, DVD players, laptops, etc. represent the object structure and the operations performed (reserving) represent the algorithm.
